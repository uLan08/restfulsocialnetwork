The tokens are stored on the server using a @tokenStorageService@ bean. The plugin comes with out-of-the-box support
for JWT, Memcached, GORM and [Grails Cache|http://grails.org/plugin/cache], but you can use your own strategy implementing the
[TokenStorageService|http://alvarosanchez.github.io/grails-spring-security-rest/latest/docs/gapi/grails/plugin/springsecurity/rest/token/storage/TokenStorageService.html]
interface.

{note}
The default implementation, [JWT|guide:jwt], is stateless. Nothing is really stored. However, the plugin still gives a
chance to the other implementations to store the principal if they need to.
